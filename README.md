# ansible-i2c-busboard
![Alt text](AnsibleBusboard.jpg?raw=true "I2CBB")

This is a remix of the monome I2C busboard for Teletype, but to mount on the back of ansible. Designed primarily for those wanting to experiment with the PolyES Ansible firmware and communicate with external I2C devices. Or its also handy if your Teletype is in and out of a case often and the Ansible is a bit more fixed
